## Coding Standards
### Documentation
- Read the docs/AiKnowledgeBase.md for contextual details about the solution.

- Maintain and update as necessary the README.md
- Document configuration settings
- Include setup instructions
- Use XML comments for public APIs
- Document deployment process


### C# Guidelines
- Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions
- Use C# 12 features appropriately
- Prefer pattern matching over type checking
- Use records for DTOs and immutable data
- Use init-only properties where appropriate
- Use file-scoped namespaces
- Utilize nullable reference types
- Implement IAsyncDisposable for async cleanup
- Use the Result Pattern when applicable
- When returning objects as JSON result in api watch out for circular references.

### Asynchronous Programming
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Avoid async void except for event handlers
- Use CancellationToken for cancellable operations
- Implement proper exception handling in async methods
- Use Task.WhenAll for parallel operations
- Avoid blocking calls in async methods
- Where possible use SignalR for real time updates

### Security
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use anti-forgery tokens for forms
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper role-based authorization
- Store secrets in Azure Key Vault
- Use managed identities where possible
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Database
- Use  SQL (TSQL for SqlServer) script-base migrations
- Place SQL scripts in Data/PendingMigrations
- Use GUID (UID) for primary keys
- Implement soft delete where appropriate
- Use appropriate indexes
- Include relevant DataAnnotations
- Include DataAnnotations for Key, DatabaseGenerated, DisplayName, format
- Use stored procedures for complex queries
- Implement database timeouts
- Use connection pooling

### Error Handling
- Implement global exception handling
- Use custom exception types
- Log exceptions with context
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement retry policies for transient failures
- Use problem details for API errors
- Use the Result Pattern

### Logging
- Use ILogger<T> in all services, workers, controllers
- Include correlation IDs
- Log appropriate detail levels
- Structure log messages
- Include relevant context
- Log security events
- Implement proper log rotation

### Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Implement integration tests for APIs
- Use xUnit for testing framework
- Mock external dependencies
- Use test data builders
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Test both success and failure paths

### Performance
- Implement response caching where appropriate
- Use async/await properly
- Implement proper DB indexing
- Use compression for responses
- Optimize database queries
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Use CDN for static assets

### UI/UX
- Follow Bootstrap best practices
- Implement responsive design
- Use proper semantic HTML
- Follow WCAG accessibility guidelines
- Implement proper form validation
- Use proper error messages
- Implement loading states
- Use proper toast notifications

### Design
Design a modern, elegant, and highly intuitive UI/UX for a social quiz and chat app.
The design should be:
- Visually refined and consistent, with a clean layout and ample white space.
- User-centric, ensuring an effortless and smooth flow through the main features.
- Responsive across devices, with a minimal yet stylish aesthetic.
- Aligned with contemporary design trends like neumorphism, glassmorphism, or soft shadows (optional based on your style).
- Focused on accessibility and clear call-to-actions.
- Prioritize hierarchy, typography, and visual storytelling. Think Apple-level polish with the usability of Notion or Linear.
- Use a soft, neutral color palette with accent colors for key actions.
- Put all the styles in linked stylesheets. Do not embed <style> tags in views (.cshtml files). 


### Code Organization
- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Use proper dependency injection
- Implement repository pattern
- Use service layer pattern
- Organize by feature when possible
- Keep controllers thin
- Use proper view models
- Implement proper validation

### Source Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Follow GitFlow branching strategy
- Use pull requests for changes
- Include proper .gitignore
- Protect main branch
- Use semantic versioning

### Configuration
- Use strongly-typed configuration
- Use proper environment variables
- Store secrets in Key Vault
- Use proper configuration sections
- Implement configuration validation
- Use proper defaults

### Deployment
- Implement proper CI/CD
- Use proper environment separation
- Implement blue-green deployment
- Use proper monitoring
- Implement proper backup strategy

### Monitoring
- Implement Application Insights
- Monitor performance metrics
- Set up proper alerting
- Monitor error rates
- Track user behavior

### Project Structure
- core code, entities models, services, database migrations go in the GreenSync-lib project
- the main user interface goes in the GreenSync-app project
- admistrative functions go in the admin area of the  GreenSync-app project
- You may create new files as you see fit but always ask before editing or replacing existing files.
- DO NOT read or edit anything in the GreenSync-admin
