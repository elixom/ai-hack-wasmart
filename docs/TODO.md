- [ ] Implement proper async/await patterns in data access

### Quality Assurance Tasks

#### 10. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for all Entity Framework services
- [ ] Create integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Test concurrent access scenarios
- [ ] Validate soft delete functionality
- [ ] Test audit trail and timestamp functionality
- [ ] Verify decimal precision for financial calculations

#### 11. Security and Compliance
- [ ] Implement proper data sanitization
- [ ] Add input validation at entity level
- [ ] Test SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Verify GDPR compliance for soft deletes
- [ ] Implement proper logging for audit requirements

#### 12. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README.md with database setup instructions
- [ ] Create database administration guide
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Update API documentation with new endpoints
- [ ] Create developer onboarding guide for database

### Future Enhancement Tasks

#### 13. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement real-time SignalR integration with database
- [ ] Add Azure Spatial SQL features for geographic queries
- [ ] Integrate with Azure OpenAI for enhanced route optimization
- [ ] Implement database-driven configuration management
- [ ] Add support for IoT sensor data integration

#### 14. Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Set up Application Insights integration
- [ ] Implement database performance monitoring
- [ ] Create business intelligence dashboards
- [ ] Set up automated reporting systems
- [ ] Implement predictive analytics for maintenance scheduling

#### 15. Deployment and DevOps
- [ ] Set up staging environment database
- [ ] Create deployment automation scripts
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment for database changes
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Create database monitoring and alerting

### Known Issues to Address

#### Technical Debt
- [ ] **URGENT**: Fix FleetVehicle.cs compilation errors (Route type references)
- [ ] Resolve any circular dependency issues in Entity Framework models
- [ ] Update existing view models to work with GUID identifiers instead of strings
- [ ] Migrate from session-based authentication to proper Identity integration

#### Migration Considerations

- [ ] Create data validation scripts for migration verification

### Priority Matrix

#### Critical (Must Complete Before Production)
1. Database schema deployment and validation
2. Application configuration with connection strings
3. Replace in-memory services with EF implementations
4. Fix compilation errors
5. Configure Identity integration

#### Important (Should Complete Soon)
1. Comprehensive testing suite
2. Data seeding and sample data
3. Performance optimization
4. Security validation
